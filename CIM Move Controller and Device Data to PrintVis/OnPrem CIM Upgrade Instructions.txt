#PrintVis 26 Feature Release have had some major changes in the PrintVis CIM app, that will prevent existing installation from upgrading directly.
#The reason for this - was that 2 tables was moved into the PrintVis App from the PrintVis CIM App(PTE App for Cloud)
#To limit the amount of breaking changes - the following has been done:
#Moved some parts of the Pages into the PrintVis App with the same name, where the reamining parts has been kept as a new PageExtension.
#The same has been done to the tables "PVS CIM Controller" and "PVS CIM Device".
  
#A upgrade guide has been made, that needs to be followed to get data transferred from a older version into the newer version.
#!!!WAIT!!!
